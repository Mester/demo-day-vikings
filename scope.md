##### Ben Dauer

Committed to a life of continual study and learning, decided to make the switch to programming when he accepted that, while rabbinical students get to spend much of their time learning and tackling new challenges, rabbis do not. Programmers do. Also he'd be a terrible at the whole warm, charismatic community leader thing.

#### *Short description of your app.* What’s going to do? What’s problem is going to solve?

Finding new music-that you actually enjoy-on Reddit can be a slog. Our app will accept a genre-keyword from the user and generate a list of ten recent, trending songs for that genre, sourced from [/r/listentothis](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/). Songs will be selected per our own, proprietary algorithm.
