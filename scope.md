##### Ben Dauer

Committed to a life of continual study and learning, decided to make the switch to programming when he accepted that, while rabbinical students get to spend much of their time learning and tackling new challenges, rabbis do not. Programmers do. Also he'd be a terrible at the whole warm, charismatic community leader thing.

##### Adrian Hintermaier

Just casually doing my 2nd demo day. Otherwise I'm studying for a Master of Computer Science and Engineering degree at Lund University in Sweden. Almost finished with it, all that's left is my graduation project/thesis (which I am currently looking for).

Finding new music on Reddit can be a slog. Our app will accept a genre keyword from the user and return ten recent, trending (using our own algorithm, not Reddit's) songs in that genre, sourced from [/r/listentothis](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/).
